<h1>MY FAVOURITE MOVIES OF 2023</h1>

<h2>Top 3 on my movies list</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Lucifer</h3>

<p>
What I love most about Lucifer is the fact that it gives perspective to the devil's side of the story. 
The bible only tells the story of from God's point of view and why he was disappointed to the point of casting out his son 
after he rebelled against him. The movie on the other hand gives a detailed account of why Lucifer rebelled against his 
father in the first place, hence, exposing God's failure to be a good father to his children while neglecting his own wife.

<h3>Fisherman's Dairy</h3>

<p>
This movie is a Cameroonian movie produced ny Kang Quintus, which depicts an era where girs were not considered worthy Of 
a formal education just like boys. A father who literally forces his teenage daughter into marriage just so she doesn't try to 
attend school and ends up almost loosing his only child because she was being maltreated, beaten up and raped by the old man 
who is meant to be her husband.

<h3>The Moon Embracing the Sun</h3>

<p>
This Korean classic has neem on my favs list since 2011 and I can't count how many times I have watched it over amd over 
again. It tells the love story of crown prince who falls in love with a young girl from one clan but his grandmother doesn't 
support his choice because he wants her grandson to marry a girl from her clan so that the future queen will be a native of 
her tribe and daughter of her close ally.
